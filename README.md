# gkilpatrick_HW7

Project Description:
This project is a first attempt on making a form page using HTML and CSS files, for Michael Colbert's Digital Product Management class. This project has five html pages, starting with the index page and ending with gkilpatrick_p4.html, which is a thank you page. The main goal of the form is to gather information regarding business analytics students.

Best Practices:
My webform demonstrates compliance to several best practices for forms in order to ensure a smooth user experience as well as strong data collection. My form uses clear and consicse labeling for each different input field, making the form usable and accessible to those with screen reader. I have also used the appropriate input types for each question in the survey, such as using text fields, dropdowns, radio buttons, and checkboxes in areas that make sense for optimal data collection. 

My form also uses validation techniques such as having clear HTML for required items, with required fields being made clear to users and options available for those that do not wish to answer certain questions. This approach will allow users to minimize errors in data input and streamline the data gathering and entering process. Finally, by having the survey broken down into several different and clearly labeled pages, I was able to avoid overloading users with information on one single page.
