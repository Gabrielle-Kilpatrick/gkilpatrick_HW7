# gkilpatrick_HW7

Project Description:
This project is a first attempt on making a form page using HTML and CSS files, for Michael Colbert's Digital Product Management class. This project has five html pages, starting with the index page and ending with gkilpatrick_p4.html, which is a thank you page. The main goal of the form is to gather information regarding business analytics students.

Best Practices:
My webform demonstrates compliance to several best practices for forms in order to ensure a smooth user experience as well as strong data collection. My form uses clear and consicse labeling for each different input field, making the form usable and accessible to those with screen reader. I have also used the appropriate input types for each question in the survey, such as using text fields, dropdowns, radio buttons, and checkboxes in areas that make sense for optimal data collection. 

My design is also mobile friendly, with a centered single column to make it accessible in a mobile format. Design wise, my form has a clear flow of starting with basic information many forms ask and ending with the most sensitive questions. No unnecessary data is being collected, and users are able to opt out of questions they don't feel comfortable asking. At the bottom of my page I have also included a progress indicator in the form of page numbers. 

My form also uses validation techniques such as having clear HTML for required items, with required fields being made clear to users and options available for those that do not wish to answer certain questions. This approach will allow users to minimize errors in data input and streamline the data gathering and entering process. Finally, by having the survey broken down into several different and clearly labeled pages, I was able to avoid overloading users with information on one single page. 

Overall, my form adheres to best practices by using clear descriptions, and by prioritizing usability and accessibility.

Accessibility:
In terms of accessibility, my form uses several different techniques to ensure that all users can feel included and be able to access the web form. I have provided descriptive labels for form elements so that screen reader users are able to properly view the items. I have also used structured HTML elements to ensure clear document structure to help in screen readers being able to smoothly interpret the form. 

My forms also use color contract in the design, as well as different sized headings and easy to read font that 4ensure readability for users with visual imparitments. Each question on the form is labeled as either optional or required to allow users to easily understand and access what is necessary for them to fill out.
